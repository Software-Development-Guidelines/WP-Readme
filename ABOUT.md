# About

The CMS Changelog is created by [Antonio Devís](https://github.com/colomet).

The CMS Changelog is a fork of [keepachangelog](http://keepachangelog.com) specification is authored by [Olivier Lacan](http://olivierlacan.com/) with influence of [Wordpress](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Versions) and [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html#Change-Logs).

If you'd like to leave feedback, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/colomet/CMSchangelog/issues).


# How can I contribute?

This document is not the truth; it’s my carefully considered opinion, along with information and examples I gathered. Although I provide an actual CHANGELOG on the GitHub repo.

This is because I want our community to reach a consensus. I believe the discussion is as important as the end result.
